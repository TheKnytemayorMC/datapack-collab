# datapack-collab

Hello collaborators.
This repo is made so that you can
work together and with me to create
data packs. if you have ideas,
dont hesitate to comment on my posts
in the community tab in my YouTube channel.

How the process of data pack creation
works is that I will post a video
on YouTube that will announce the beginning
of a new pack. Youll be able to go to
the URL I put in the video description
and it will take you here.

Don't worry about other projects!
I will release them as versions of
this repo so the download and code
will be able to be downloadsvle and readable,
respectively.

Thanks for reading this!
What can't data packs do?...
